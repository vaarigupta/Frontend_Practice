#Tim berner's lee discovered html in 1990
html and xhtml are basics that was firstly discovered 
mow-a-days , html5 and css3 are being used for creating web-pages.

#There are basically two extensions for the html files ->
.html
.htm 
the basic difference b/w two is that .html could not be  
recognised by windows 3x and dos as it's a 4 character extension .
but now the technology has become advanced , new os has been launched
so that .html extensions are easily recognised by them as 
html files ,otherwise both are referencing to a html files .
no difference at all .

#the tag <br /> is used with a space b/w 'br' and forward slash '/'
because it will create problem when we create complex web page 

#for making the text bold , we can use either <b> or <strong>.
#for making the text italics, we can use either <i> or <em>.

#for horizontal line , we use <hr /> or <hr >

# The <blockquote> tag specifies a section that is quoted from
another source.
basically it used to specify the content that is copyright from
another source 

# there are 3 types of lists in html ->
 ** NUMBERED LIST -> we use <ol>
 **BULLETED LIST -> we use <ul>
 **DEFINITION LIST -> we use <dl> moreover , we have to use two more tags 
   <dt> (used for the "term" )and <dd> (used for "describing" the term) 
   this is used for creating indentation b/w terms and description

# <li> tag is always used in all the three types of list for 
  writing element

# if we are linking different web pages then then we use anchor tag 
<a href = "...."> like this and put the url( uniform resource locator)
which will link all the web pages together and if we have changed the directory 
then we can link the web page in that directory by using dir name and the web page
and one more thing , if we wanna move up to another dir and link our web pages
then we will use "../" 

# one more thing , if we wanna show our web page in a new tab then we will use 
an attribute -> target = "_blank" in the anchor tag

# to open a link to a webpage in new tab , we use another attribute 
target = "_blank" in the anchor tag

#If we want to link the paragraph  then instead of using <P> tag with the 
paragraph we will use anchor <a name = "xyz"> tag with the paragraph
and we use that paragraph link again with a anchor tag < a href ="name of the file#xyz" >
